dm2 for Debian
----------------

To install the dm2 modules package you better use module-assistant. To get,
build and install, simply run:

    module-assistant auto-install dm2

(or "m-a a-i dm2").

To build with make-kpkg and install manually please consult the documentation
of dpkg (manpage) and kernel-package.

IMPORTANT: In order to get the LEDs on the dm2 device working, you need to
patch your kernel with the linux-lowspeedbulk.patch.
